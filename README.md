<h1 style="teax-allign:center">5-th lab in Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>This project contains a "game" with a car that has a mobile pendulum attached to the middle. The target of the project is to automatically change the speed of the car taking in account a bunch of confusing values, and keep the pendulum in equilibrium</p>
